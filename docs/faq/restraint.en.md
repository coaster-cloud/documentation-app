# Description of restraint systems

A restraint system ensures a safe experience on the attraction. Some systems are often combined with each other.
Can you provide missing descriptions? Then please contact us at [contact](../contact/index.md).

## Lap bar

!!! info ""
    A support surface that applies pressure to the abdomen or lower back to stabilise your position during the ride. It can be a separate bar for each passenger or, in some attractions, a bar across the entire width of the row of seats. In newer attractions, this bar also comes from above.

## Shoulder restraints

!!! info ""
    A stirrup system that is placed on your shoulders from above. As a rule, the head is inserted between the stirrups on the right and left and the stem is pressed onto the upper body. Often this bar is also secured with an additional safety belt from below.

## Waistcoat hanger

!!! info ""
    The waistcoat strap is very similar to the shoulder strap. A kind of waistcoat is incorporated, which exerts even more extensive but better distributed pressure on the upper body.
