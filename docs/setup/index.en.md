- :material-chart-bar-stacked: Get your own statistics

    ---
    From the registration of park visits and attractions ridden, we create extraordinary statistics.

- :fontawesome-brands-fort-awesome: Count visits

    ---
    Every park visit that is recorded can be tracked by you and counted for the statistics. This results in awesome statistics.

- :material-counter: Count rides

    ---
    We love statistics. That's why we `count` our rides. This results in crazy statistics.

- :material-heart-plus: Favoriten festlegen

    ---
    Set your favorite parks or attractions, to get a faster access.

- :material-image-plus: Upload images

    ---
    Upload photos of objects (It's not a family album) and let other users rate your photos :material-thumb-up-outline:. By the way, the most beautiful and rated photos are often available as cover images.

- :material-source-pull: Contribution

    ---
    With your profile you can contribute to our `coaster.cloud` database. How this works? See it [here](../contribute/).

    ---
    Users can be grouped together by entering a code. You will now see the `counts` of the others. [BETA][^1]
