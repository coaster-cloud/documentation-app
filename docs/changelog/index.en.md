# Whats new? Changelog of development

Here you will find the changes that are available in the app.
We mark the version number that you can track in the app.

## Semantic versioning

The versioning shows the extent of the change. It is separated into three groups:

> `Major` . `Minor` . `Patch` -> Example: Version 1.10.1

A `Major` version, is a new release of our app.<br>
A `minor` version, adds new features or changes existing features in the app.<br>
A `patch` version, corrects minor bugs without changing or providing new features.

As the changes are made, we mark it :arrows_clockwise: Functions we have changed.<br>
Entries with :new: are new features.

## Translation

The changes in the app will only be available in English. Since the information is already created in english during the development of the app, we will only save the translation here. The functions are sufficiently described in the manual. Thank you for your understanding.
