# General information about Contribution

Our `coaster.cloud` is a community project and thrives on the participation of volunteers.
The technical term for this would be `contributor`. And we will now explain to you how easy it is to do this.

## Requirements

In order to contribute data to the coaster.cloud, you need a *free* account. This is the *same* account that you can use within the coaster.cloud. As someone who contributes to our database, you are called a `contributor`. For your contributions you will be named in the credits of the changes ([EXAMPLE](https://coaster.cloud/en/activities)) The contributions are also listed under parks and attractions.

## Expectations

We would like to ask every `contributor` to carefully enrich our database with data. Every change will also be archived and can be discarded by us in case of emergency. We hope to give enough examples in this manual of how we envision the database. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with us, you can also visit us at ([Discord](/contact/#discord)).
