# Edit park

We define a 'park' as any place where a recreational facility has been set up. For security reasons, a new park can only be created by our administration team.

!!! info "Not sure?"
    If you are not sure, you can ask your question in our ([Discord Channel](/contact/#discord)).

## Basic data

### Name of the leisure facility

!!! info ""
    The name of the facility should primarily be written in *country language*, but in *Latin* bush letters.<br>
    For example: `Disneyland Shanghai` - and not: `Disneyland China` or `上海迪士尼乐园`.<br>
    <br>
    A `resort` is a grouping of several facilities.<br>
    Example: `Heide Park` is part of the Heide Park Resort.

### Category

!!! info ""
    In which category will the facility be assigned. Missing categories will be created by our administrators.

### Status

!!! info ""
    Under construction -> not yet open
    Former -> will no longer open: closed forever
    Out of service -> temporarily closed (note opening hours - not: offseason)
    In operation -> facility is generally open (note opening hours)

### Timezone

!!! info ""
    In which time zone ([overview](https://everytimezone.com/){:target="_blank"}) is the facility located.

### Web

!!! info ""
    This is where the official website of the institution goes. Please make sure that the main page is called up.
    If the institution has an automatic redirection to a language-specific URL, select the main URL without the language variable.<br>
    <br>
    *Example*:<br>
    :white_check_mark: Correct: https://energylandia.pl/<br>
    :x: False: https://energylandia.pl/de/

### Coordinates

!!! info ""
    In order to display the facility on our map and measure distances, we need the coordinates.
    Please enter the **latitude** and **longitude** as decimal values.
    <br>
    *Example:*<br>
    `Disneyland Paris` > [Google Maps Link](https://goo.gl/maps/4x59PDUgHtNSNkdU8){:target="_blank"}

## Shortdescription

!!! info ""
    Provide a stylish short description of the park. Please do not copy Wikipedia texts or marketing texts of the leisure facility. Describe in your own words what makes this place so special.

## Adress

!!! info ""
    Enter the correct address data that would be required for navigation. For large complexes such as Walt Disney World, use the information provided in the official description of the leisure facility.

`Note on the federal state`: This information is currently primarily intended for the German region in order to take holiday periods into account for the visit forecast. But you can still enter the state.

## Additional Information

!!! info ""
    Not interesting for everyone, but cool facts - we collect under additional information.

### Area

!!! info ""
    Have you found information about the total area of the recreational facility? Write down the value in square metres (metric system)!
    By the way, you can convert reliably with Google Help: ? `31 hectare in m2` = 310000
    Of course we leave out the "dot" in the number ;)

### Construction costs

!!! info ""
    Rarely, but possible - is it possible to find information on the construction costs of a leisure attraction. This does not mean "the newest ride", but the costs that the park itself has stated, e.g. in a press release.

### Dogs permitted

!!! info ""
    Whether or not you want to take your faithful best friend to an amusement park is something you basically have to decide for yourself. But some leisure facilities are happy to answer this basic question for you. Is it allowed to take a dog to this facility? Yes or no.
    PS: Dog owners will be very grateful for this information!

### GoPro on attractions

!!! info ""
    A delicate question of safety and much debated! The synonym `GoPro` stands here for any kind of action camera that could come into conceivable use. We have 3 answer options here with the following idea behind them:

    * Permitted :material-check:{ .heart }<br>
    Basically, there is a general permission to carry cameras on a trip under conditions. In this case, it makes sense to take a look at the homepage of the recreational facility to check the details for this.

    * Prohibited :material-camera-off:<br>
    Do not even think about it! A 'no' is a 'no'. Also don`t hold up anyone in the station with unnecessary discussions.

    * On request :material-progress-question:<br>
    There are operators who allow a camera on the ride on request under certain conditions. The following applies: "You ask in advance by mail". However, this is not a promise that you will get a `yes`.

## Theme area

!!! info ""
    Many leisure facilities divide their entertainment area into different (themed) areas - zones of the park. This makes it easier for us to additionally assign the attractions to a theme area. Please use the local name of the theme area and not your own translation.

    The attractions that have subsequently been assigned there can now be set as a filter on a park with just one click. This makes it easier to manage the park and its many attractions.

## Historical information

!!! info ""
    Under this information we collect data on the opening, renaming or even closing of a leisure facility.

## Contributions

!!! info ""
    Many hard-working volunteers who support our `coaster.cloud` leave their mark. All edits are honoured here in a listing. If YOU would like to be there too, then simply contribute something to our database ;)

    The so-called [contributors](/contribute) are listed here. In the brackets behind the name is the number of changes to this object.
