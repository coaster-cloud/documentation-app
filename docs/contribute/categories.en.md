# Definition of attraction categories

In the scene of amusement park fans, there may well be different opinions that could make a categorisation of an attraction uniform. As the operator of the app, we therefore provide our version of the categorisation and hope for a general acceptance and tollerance of the selection.

## Rollercoaster

!!! info ""
    A roller coaster should be a "guided ride system". It does not have to have a closed circuit (Boomerang Coaster).

## Escape Room

!!! info ""
    An Escape Room is usually a closed room from which one is supposed to "escape" by solving puzzles and tasks.

## Labytinth

!!! info ""
    A labyrinth has at least one entrance and one exit. The visitor is not given a route to follow, but the intention is to make him stay in the labyrinth as long as possible by confusing him.

## Museum

!!! info ""
    A museum exhibits artefacts. It is usually a place with historical or artistic aspects.

## Toboggan run

!!! info ""
    On a toboggan run, the route usually leads from an elevation / mountain down into the valley. It can be a simple type in the form of a track with a flexible sliding mat or a sledge-guided system of slides.

## Round / High Ride

!!! info ""
    A ride that is in a smaller space and goes round (in a circle) or upwards.

## Slide

!!! info ""
    With a slide, there is no need for aids such as carpet or guided sledges to get from a starting point to the finishing point. There are also slides that offer direct support in the form of a roller system - sometimes with a support system (e.g. box, for safety).

## Sauna

!!! info ""
    You often come across saunas in wellness & leisure pools. Since we offer bathing areas for counselling, why not also a sauna!

## Scare Zone

!!! info ""
    At Halloween time, the Scare Zones are defined by an area in which the theming, usually also supported by actors, becomes a zone of fright. Not for the faint-hearted.

## Pool

!!! info ""
    The complete categorisation of a bathing landscape naturally also includes a swimming pool. Here, too, there are bathing landscapes that offer several pools and themes.

## Point of interest

!!! info ""
    A "MUST SEE" on the tour? Then it's sights that belong to a leisure facility.

## Show

!!! info ""
    An artistic-entertaining performance by actors in the form of a (planned) show. Simple street acts are not included. Shows are usually offered several times a day and over a longer period of time. They can take place indoors and outdoors.

## Game / Arcade

!!! info ""
    Eine Ansammlung von Spielgeräten. Sei es mechanisch oder elektrisch. Eine kleine Halle in der Spielgeräte auf ihren Einsatz warten. Häufig unter Einsatz von Bargeld (oder ähnlichem Credits) und somit eher etwas für Personen ab 16 Jahren.

## Playground

!!! info ""
    Primary space intended for children where equipment is provided for playful purposes.

## Theme ride

!!! info ""
    A themed ride takes place at a very moderate speed and passes through a setting or story. The focus is on the theming and not on the mode of transport or the means of transport. This category often offers potential for discussion whether the attraction should be listed under this category or belong to another category.

    An example of this would be [Pirates in Batavia](https://coaster.cloud/attractions/bdc846ea-piraten-in-batavia) in [Europa Park](https://coaster.cloud/parks/d540427b-europa-park) - in our view, this is a themed ride, as the presentation of the ride is primarily in the foreground and should therefore not be called a "water ride".

    In comparison, [De Vliegende Hollander](https://coaster.cloud/attractions/e8d87731-de-vliegende-hollander) in the Dutch [Efteling](https://coaster.cloud/parks/49f00560-efteling) would not be a themed ride. The station and parts of the track are very attractively themed, but the ride is a *rail-guided system* like a roller coaster, ending on a lake as a boat ride. Actually, with the designation `hybrid coaster` a completely new category.

## Animal

!!! info ""
    An animal attraction is not only found in the circus. Of course, game enclosures or similar areas also come under this category.

## Transport ride

!!! info ""
    To get from A to B, many leisure facilities use transport vehicles. These can be buses, trains, cable cars or similar. If these are themed to make the ride more exciting - that is good - but does not count as a themed ride. The main characteristic of a transport ride is several stations for getting on and off. The purpose is to cover a longer distance, e.g. to the other end of the park.

## Unknown

!!! info ""
    If you are unsure but want to create a new attraction, then set this category. We will then take control and assign the attraction to a category.

## Walk trough

!!! info ""
    Unlike a maze, the goal here is to walk through a planned route. This type is often used for indoor attractions where you are on foot. If it is a 'Halloween attraction' (maze), please categorise it as such. Later on, also use the marker 'Operating period: Halloween' in the tab [Additional information].

## Water ride

!!! info ""
    A classic water ride takes a boat through a given channel. Here, the current of the water propels the boat forward. A rail-guided launch or slope does not lead to the roller coaster category here.

## Waterslide

!!! info ""
    With the help of a transporter (or in swimwear), you go down a slope by gravity. You are carried on a sheet of water.
