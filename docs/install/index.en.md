# Installation

## Create an account

Using `coaster.cloud` is free to use witout a registered account. The website and app can be used without any registration.
However, if you want to use functions that are related to you as a person - such as `counting` for rides, then of course an account is necessary.
The good thing is - you can use both: the website and app account is identical. We won't tie the account to a single device.

## App Download

You will find the free app

## Browser usage

Our website is connected to the app. However, for the reasons of good architecture, we have not kept all the functions the same. In particular, the [contribution](../contribute/) is executed on the web page.
