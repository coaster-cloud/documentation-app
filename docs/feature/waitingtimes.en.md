# Waiting times at coaster.cloud App

With the waiting times overview you know exactly where there is currently a higher rush in the amusement park. Unfortunately, we cannot provide an overview for every amusement facility and the availability is only displayed in the app - not on our Website.
Navigate to a theme park of your choice and click on the menu item "Current waiting times".

## Waiting time alarm

Of course, it makes sense to keep an eye on the attraction when waiting times decrease. The `coaster.cloud` app also does this without any problems. In the current view you can find the last determined waiting time. Here you can also directly see a current trend of the last hour. You can use the **Waiting time alarm clock** to setup an alert on your prefered time.

- Decreasing waiting time: green decreasing arrow :material-arrow-bottom-right:{ .green }
- Increasing waiting time: Red ascending arrow :material-arrow-top-right:{ .red }

!!! tip "Check out: :material-alarm-multiple:{.gold} Activate our cue line alert!"

    - Click on the waiting time for which you want to set an notification alert
    - Click on "Wait time notification"
    - Set the minutes to the desired time
    - But stay realistic - the app can't make the queue shorter :)

    As soon as the waiting time reaches your forced time, you will get a [notification](/feature/notification)!

<small>For the introduction of the function, initially only the setting of an alarm is possible. An overview of the set alarms or the deletion is currently not yet supported. The set alarms expire after midnight at the latest.</small>
